# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Multi-Collection PDF Analysis System designed for Challenge 1b.

5. WHEN extracting sections THEN the system SHALL include section titles and page numbers

### Requirement 5: Subsection Analysis and Refinement

**User Story:** As a user needing detailed content analysis, I want refined text extraction at the subsection level, so that I can access granular information without reading entire documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing subsection analysis THEN the system SHALL extract refined text content
2. WHEN refining text THEN the system SHALL maintain original meaning while improving clarity
3. WHEN extracting subsections THEN the system SHALL preserve page number references
4. IF subsection content is redundant THEN the system SHALL consolidate or prioritize unique information
5. WHEN refining text THEN the system SHALL ensure content remains factually accurate

### Requirement 6: JSON Input/Output Processing

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want standardized JSON input and output formats, so that I can easily integrate the system with other tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving input THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure with challenge_info (challenge_id, test_case_name, description), documents array (filename, title), persona (role), and job_to_be_done (task) fields
2. WHEN processing input THEN the system SHALL handle multiple test cases including travel planning, HR form management, and recipe collection scenarios
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL include metadata with input_documents list, persona, job_to_be_done, and processing_timestamp
4. WHEN creating extracted_sections THEN the system SHALL include document, section_title, importance_rank (1-N), and page_number fields
5. WHEN generating subsection_analysis THEN the system SHALL include document, refined_text, and page_number fields
6. IF input JSON is malformed THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages
7. WHEN outputting results THEN the system SHALL format timestamps as ISO format (e.g., "2025-07-10T15:31:22.632389")

### Requirement 7: Performance and Resource Constraints

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant with limited resources, I want the system to operate within strict performance bounds, so that it meets competition requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing document collections THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 60 seconds
2. WHEN running the system THEN it SHALL operate on CPU only without GPU requirements
3. WHEN deploying the system THEN the total model size SHALL be â‰¤ 1GB
4. IF processing exceeds time limits THEN the system SHALL return partial results with status indicators
5. WHEN operating THEN the system SHALL function without internet access

### Requirement 8: Multi-Domain Generalization

**User Story:** As a system handling diverse content types, I want the solution to work across different domains and document types, so that it can handle various hackathon test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing academic research papers THEN the system SHALL identify methodologies, datasets, and benchmarks
2. WHEN analyzing business documents THEN the system SHALL extract financial trends and strategic information
3. WHEN handling educational content THEN the system SHALL identify key concepts and learning objectives
4. IF domain-specific terminology is encountered THEN the system SHALL maintain context understanding
5. WHEN switching between domains THEN the system SHALL adapt analysis approach accordingly

### Requirement 9: Scoring Optimization

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant aiming for high scores, I want the system optimized for the competition scoring criteria, so that I can maximize my evaluation points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting sections THEN the system SHALL optimize for section relevance scoring (60 points maximum)
